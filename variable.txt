Runtime execution:
    variable data is stores on ram space - volatile memory
    non-volatile memory: secondary storage space - hard disk

variable:
    -used to specify the location of data
    -label for location data
    -it may change during program execution
Syntax:

    Syntax :data_type var_name
        - we need to declare the datatype before use the variable
        - it is tightly coupled - we have to specify the type of variable
    basic data types:
        integer,float,double,char
        eg : int a = 10;
